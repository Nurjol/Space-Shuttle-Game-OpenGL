# Space-Shuttle-Game-OpenGL
Using OpenGL C++ making space shuttle game( 50% done). Main idea of the game is avoid obstacles and successfully go to Earth. By passing obstacles speed will increase.  
Currently I made 5 object:
  -Earth (drawn and wrapped with texture) 
  -Moon (drawn and wrapped with texture) 
  -Environment stars (drawn and wrapped with texture) 
  -Dock (drawn and wrapped with texture) 
  -Space ship (created by blender and imported .obj file) + texture mapped 
  
  
For the future: 
  - animate environment (shuttle going forward effect)
  - make obstacles to avoid (meteors, different planets, etc...)
  - make point system.

-Please intsall OpenGL
-Check loading file paths are correct(shuttle.obj)
